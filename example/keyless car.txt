/* 
One of the latest automotive technologies, push-button keyless system, allows you to start
your car's engine without the hassle of key insertion and offers great convenience. 

Push-button keyless system allows owner with key-fob in her pocket to unlock the door when she is very near the car.
The driver can slide behind the wheel, with the key-fob in her pocket 
(briefcase or purse or anywhere inside the car), she can push the start/stop button on the control panel. 
Shutting off the engine is just as hassle-free, and is accomplished by merely pressing the start/stop button. 

These systems are designed so it is impossible to start the engine without the owner's key-fob
and it cannot lock your key-fob inside the car because the system will sense it and prevent 
the user from locking them in.

However, the keyless system can also surprise you as it may allow you to drive the car without key-fob.
This has happened to Jin Song when his wife droped him to his office on the way to a shopping mall but
the key-fob was in Jin Song's pocket. At the shopping mall, when the engine was turned off, the car could
not be locked or re-started again. Jin Song had to take a taxi to the mall to pass the key-fob.
This really motivated Jin Song to come up the model :-)
