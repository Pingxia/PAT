那个我是乱乱写的。。。欢迎大家改。。
反正就是说下我们用的model是 probabilistic real-time system model
The code has grammar error and is not completed. 我觉得其实也没必要show 完整的code，因为反正不能run。。。就放点句子在ppt里面就好了
Assumptions:
1.Probability
at any point of time in the morning, there's 15% chance of an elderly patient arriving, 10% chance of a student patient arriving, 5% of a employee falling ill and 70% chance of no patient arriving........ rest of the prob. refer to code
2. each consulting time is 30 min. will vary according to patient type in the later version.
3. If waiting time>60 min patient will leave.

Goal: 
1. find the satisfaction level of this hospital rated by patients. using KPI as the the number of patients leaving the hospital without treatment. If the number is less than 10, we consider the hospital reaches the goal. in later version can calculate total waiting time.....
2. find minimum number of doctors needed in the hospital so that with 90% prob. count< 10.
........(blalalalala)

sorry ahhhhh, really dun know how to write the modellllll, maybe we can consult prof!!!
